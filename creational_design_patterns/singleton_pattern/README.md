# Singleton Design Pattern

- provides a signle instance of an object
- gurantees that there are no duplicates

## Usecases:
- when you want to use the same connection to a database to make every query
- when you open SSH connection to a server to do a few tasks
- if you need to limit the access to some variable or space
- if you need to limit the number of calls to some places

## When to apply:
- we need a single, shared value of some particular type
- we need to restrict object creation of some type to a single unit along with entire program
